BURDEN

[Intro]
Am    Dm    x6

[Verse 1]
Am        Dm        G
   I, once upon a time
Gm         C        D
Carried a burden inside
    Dm              C
(I) sung a last goodbye
  Dm     C         G    Bb
A broken rhyme I'd underlined 
           C        A7        Dm  G   Bb  A
There's an ocean of sorrow in you
     Dm  G    Bb  A
A sorrow in me

[Verse 2]
Am          Dm                G
(I) saw a movement in their eyes
Gm         C              D
Said I no longer knew the way
      Dm            C
(I'd) given up the ghost
  Dm      C       G      Bb
A passive mind submit to fear
        C          A7          Dm  G   Bb  A
And the wait for redemption at hand
    Dm  G     Bb  D
Waiting to fail

[Organ Solo]
Dm  C   x8
Dm  G   Bb  A
         Dm  G  Bb  A
Failing again

[Verse 3]
Am         Dm               G
   If death should take me now
Gm              C            D
Count my mistakes and let me through
Dm            C
Whisper in my ear
       Dm    C         G       Bb
You've taken more than we've received
        C        A7
And the ocean of sorrow is
