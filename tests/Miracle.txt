[Intro]
Bm A Em


[Verse 1]
Bm
It's not just a phase
           A
Now let me explain
                         G
I'm working through some shit
G
Sometimes I'm medicated
Bm
It's hard to relay
                   A
The thoughts in my brain
                  G
I'm working for a life that's not domesticated


[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
It never goes the way that you planned
Bm
Success is a door that always slams
    A
I'm trying to break it
    G
I'm trying to break it
Bm
Searching for words, and praying for signs
Bm
I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
       A
Don't know how to say it
       G
Don't know how to say it


[Chorus]
D                   Bm
That I'm losing my mind
                           A
Trying to find the perfect line
Em                         Bm
I think I'm running out of time
D                   A              Em
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
                   Bm
Yeah I'm losing my mind
D                        A
Counting seconds passing by
Em                            Bm
And I don't know when I'll be fine
D                  A              Em
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
N.C.
A miracle


[Verse 2]
Bm
It's not just a show
              A
I need you to know
                      G
I'm trying to keep it real, sometimes it's complicated
Bm                                 A
This battle for gold is killing my soul
                    G                 Bm
It's hard to be yourself when all you feel is jaded


[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
It never goes the way that you planned
Bm
Success is a door that always slams
    A
I'm trying to break it
    G
I'm trying to break it
Bm
Searching for words, and praying for signs
Bm
I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
      A
Don't know how to say it
      Em
Don't know how to say it


[Chorus]
Em                 Bm
That I'm losing my mind
 D                         A
Trying to find the perfect line
 Em                        Bm
I think I'm running out of time
D                    A            Em
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
                   Bm
Yeah I'm losing my mind
D                        A
Counting seconds passing by
 Em                            Bm
And I don't know when I'll be fine
D                  A               Em
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
N.C.
A miracle

Bm D A Em

  Bm               A              Em

G
It never goes the way that you planned
G
Success is a door that always slams
    A
I'm trying to break it
    A
I'm trying to break it
G
Searching for words, and praying for signs
G
I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
      A
Don't know how to say it
A                                           Em
Don't know how to say I'm minutes away from going insane


[Chorus]
      D             Bm
Cause I'm losing my mind
   D                       A
Trying to find the perfect line
Em                         Bm
I think I'm running out of time
D                 A               Em
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
                   Bm
Yeah I'm losing my mind
D                        A
Counting seconds passing by
Em                            Bm
And I don't know when I'll be fine
D                  A              Em
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
N.C.
