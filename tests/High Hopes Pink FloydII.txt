[Verse 4]
Cm            Cm7           Ab                              
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
Cm              Cm7                 Ab
Theres a hunger still unsatisfied
Cm                      Cm7              Ab
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Cm                   Cm7                 Ab
Though down this road I've been so many times

[Chorus 2]
                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
The grass was greener
                 Cm    Dm Eb   Fm   Gm Ab
The light was brighter
                 Cm   Gm   Ab   Bb
When friends surrounded
                 Cm    Dm Eb   Fm   Gm Ab
The nights of wonder
                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
With friends surrounded
                 Cm    Dm Eb    Fm   Gm Ab            
The dawn mist glowing
                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
The water flowing
                 Cm    Dm  Eb   Fm   Gm  Ab 
The endless river
                 Cm    Gm  Ab   Bb
Forever and ever
