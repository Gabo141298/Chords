Sail to the moon - Radiohead


INTRO:] Amaj7 C F
   F         Am
I sucked the moon
    F       Am
I spoke too soon
     C  Em/B           F   Am
And how much did it cost?
        F       Am  F   Am
I was dropped from moonbeams
     C         Em/B      Amaj7 C F Amaj7 C F
And sailed on shooting stars
  F         Am
Maybe you'll
  F       Am
Be president
      C  Em/B           F   Am
But know right from wrong
         F       Am  F   Am
Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
     C     Em/B          F  Am
And sail us to the moon
 C     Em/B      F  Am
Sail us to the moon
 C   Em/B    Eb
Sail to the moon
