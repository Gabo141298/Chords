C                       C9
When the night has come
Am
There's no moon in the sky
F                    G7          C
And the stars is the only light i see
C                      C9
I wont cry  I wont cry
Am
I wont shed a tear
F              G7           C
Just as long, as you stand by me
                      C
Oh darling won't you, stand by me
Am
Stand by me
F           G7    C
Stand by me,  stand by me
