[Verse 1]

Em7                  D
Rounding deep in my sea of loathing,
Cadd9                   B7
broken your servent I kneel (Will you give it to me?)
Em7                          D
It seems what's left of my human side,
            Cadd9      B7
Is slowly changing, in me.  (Will you give it to me?)
Em7                  D
Looking at my own reflection,
                    Cadd9                  B7
when suddenly it changes, violently it changes.
Em7                  D
There is no turning back now,
                    Cadd9   B7
you've woken up the demon in me.


[Chorus]

Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness,
Cadd9         B7                      Em
open up your hate and let it flow into me.

Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness,
Cadd9           B7                      Em
madness is the gift that has been given to me.


[Intro]


[Verse 2]

Em7                           D
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising,
       Cadd9                B7
Don't try to deny what you feel (Will you give it to me?)
Em7                           D
It seems that all that was good has died,
       Cadd9      B7
And is decaying in me.  (Will you give it to me?)
Em7                          D
It seems your having some troubles,
                       Cadd9                       B7
in dealing with these changes, living with these changes.
Em7                    D
The world is a scary place,
                              Cadd9    B7
Now that you've woken up the demon in me.


[Chorus]

Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness,
Cadd9         B7                      Em
open up your hate and let it flow into me.

Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness!
Em                  D
Get up, c'mon get down with the sickness,
Cadd9           B7                      Em
madness is the gift that has been given to me.
