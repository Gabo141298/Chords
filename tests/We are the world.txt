  G                        C      D        G
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
         C           D                G
When the world  must come together as one
          Em                   
There are people dying 
         D                      C                          D
And it's time to lend a hand to live, The greatest gift of all

  G            C         D        G

We can't go on pretending day by day
     C        D                          G

That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
       Em                   D  
We are all a part of God's great big family
        C                               D
And the truth, you know, Love is all we need

Chorus:
           C    D            G
We are the World, we are the children
           C                        D                 G
We are the ones who make a brighter day so lets start giving
          Em                          D
There's a choice we're making,  We're saving our own lives
     C                        D                 G
It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me

G                               C         D       G

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
          C          D               G

And their lives will be stronger and free
   Em                  D

As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
      C                       D
So we all must lend a helping hand

Repeat Chorus:
            Cm                  D                G
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
            Cm                   D             G
But if your just believe there's no way we can fall
       Em             D
Let us realize that a change can only come
        C                 D
When we stand together as one

Repeat Chorus:
